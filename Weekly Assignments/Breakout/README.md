The game is made up of a user-controlled paddle, moving ball, and 28 bricks. The paddle is moved horizontally with the right and left keys, moving right and left respectively. If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen, one life is deducted. If the ball reaches a brick, the brick is removed and one point is added to a running scoreboard. The game is over when the score is 28, lives are 0, or the user exits the game.
