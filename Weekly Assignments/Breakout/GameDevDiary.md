I learned a lot about pygame through this project. I learned how pygame measures rectangles and circles. I learned how to add text to a pygame screen. I learned how to use a clock and add delays (there is a delay after each life is lost or the game is over). I also learned about collisions through this project. I found a way to measure the outside of a box, and use this with the position of the ball to find whether or not the ball had come in contact with the box. In the process of learning how collisions can be measured, I found that there was sometimes a merge between the ball and rectangle. I had to find a way to calculate this merge and repair the position of the ball based on it. 

I dusted off my knowledge of python. I have been programming a lot in java recently, so I had to recall a lot of my python knowledge. My main struggle with this project comes from this, as I had forgotten how classes are passed into other classes in python. I had to recall (and somewhat relearn) how classes are passed, especially as it pertains to passing rectangle objects into paddle objects. All in all, this project was a lot of fun! I got to play around with colors of the game, and every time I made progress in the game, I got to actually see it happen (even though I can see progress in programming without pygame, pygame just feels more literal, if that makes sense).
